        ZINDAGI Welfare Organization (ZWO) is a charitable, not-for-profit organization, for providing services to the most marginalized and vulnerable groups in society, including drug users, persons at-risk of or infected by HIV/AIDS, prison inmates, juvenile offenders, minor children in detention with female prisoners, street children, women and children in crisis, refugees, victims of war and disasters. All these groups are mostly poor and lack the resources to live normal lives. Poverty reduces them to a state of marginalization and deprivation in all those conditions which contribute them to human life e.g. health, education, justice, safety, security, employment and credit housing.
        </p>
        <p className='pt-4'>

ZWO services are Rights based and Needs based and include a comprehensive range of activities which cater for the physical, psychological, social, spiritual and financial needs of clients and their families. ZWO provides quality services through its large service delivery network and comprehensive awareness programmes extending all over Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and the FATA/ PAΤΑ regions. ZWO programmes are intended to stimulate and facilitate positive change, with a significant impact and long-lasting effects. ZWO strategies are aimed at individuals, families and communities in a spirit of self-help, community support and participation.

At the time of ZINDAGI WELFARE ORGANIZATION establishment, drug abuse problems were increasing progressively in Pakistan and more specifically in KP and the FATA/PATA regions due to the easy availability of cheap drugs smuggled across the border from neighbouring Afghanistan. A combination of geo-political, social and economic factors in the region contributed to the escalation of drug related issues, crime, social disorder, injustice, poverty and human rights abuses. A shift in the traditional modes of drug use by inhaling and smoking to injecting has added to the risk of HIV/AIDS, STIS, Hep B/C among drug users and other vulnerable groups. Since there were hardly any treatment facilities in existence to cater to the affected population, the founding members were motivated to set up ZWO drug addiction treatment programmes. The pioneering role of ZWO is now recognized nationally as well as internationally.
